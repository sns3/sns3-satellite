 * time plan (BSTP) configuration, which is defined in an external
 * file read by this class.
 *
 * The BSTP configuration file holds multiple lines of the following
 * content:
 *   1_col, 2_col, 3_col, 4_col, ... n_col
 *
 * The first column defines the validity of a BSTP configuration
 * (this line) in DVB-S2x superframes. The following columns define
 * which beams are enabled in this BSTP window. The ones not mentioned
 * are disabled. Each line of the BSTP configuration file may hold
 * different amount of enabled spot-beams.
 *
 * The BSTP configuration file may also hold several configuration
 * lines. Each will define different BSTP configuration and may have
 * different validity. When all the lines of a BSTP has been gone through,
 * we start again from the first BSTP configuration file. Thus, the
 * BSTP may be considered as being a pre-defined spot-beam enabling
 * pattern.
